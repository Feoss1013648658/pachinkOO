PachinkOO is a very basic implementation of the RETEOO algorithm proposed by the Drools Project (www.drools.org) that it's based on the RETE algorithm created by Charles Forgy. This implementation focus is to have a simple java project to be able to play and explain how the RETEOO algorithm works inside Drools.
